      Hayden created Southside Climbing in 2021, as soon as he qualified as a
      Rock Climbing Instructor. He loves sharing his passion of climbing with
      others and aims to make the sport more accessible to beginners.

    <p>
      When Hayden was 16, he wasn't the sporty type, until he discovered his
      local bouldering wall. <span class="hidden md:inline"
        >Then once he was old enough, at 18, he became an apprentice activity
        instructor. He's not stopped instructing for the last 6 years.

    <h3 class="h2 m-0">Our Ethos</h3>
    <p class="mb-2">
      The courses at Southside Climbing are run with the community in mind. Each
      session has a small ratio of 6 climbers per instructor, this is to ensure
      each participant has plenty of tuition and climbing time, but we also want
      to avoid overcrowding the crags.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      We're also committed to combating climate change as we operate. We use
      eco-friendly equipment sourced from sustainable manufacturers and plant
      tree's for every climbing ticket sold. When you climb with us, you're not
      only improving your skills but also supporting a business that actively
      works to protect the environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Southside Climbing, we embrace diversity and believe that rock climbing
      is for everyone. We foster an inclusive environment where all individuals,
      regardless of background or ability, feel welcome and supported. Our
      instructor adapts to different learning styles and physical abilities,
      ensuring each climber can progress at their own pace.
